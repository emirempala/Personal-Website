      <h5 class="title-of-sect">Adventure Game - <i>January 2025, AP CSA</i></h5>
      <p class="section">I worked with a partner, Michael P., on this project. The instructions were to make an text-based adventure game in Java using loops, a seperate class, and creating different methods. My partner focused on programming what commands the user could input, while I did the coding for the story and made acessors and mutators for our instance variables and the method that displayed the player's inventory. We both worked together to make the instance variables in the Character class and debug all the code.<br>
      It was our first major project in our class, and I'm proud of what we came up with! It was a challenge to debug and figure out what went wrong (especially for the commands), but we were determined to problem solve and our different perspectives helped with this. :)<br>
      We both wished we had more time to learn how to make different colored text or display images, but this is something that I might explore how to do on Java at a later date!<br>

There is also a CSS file offscreen for styling. On the other, is a preview of the website. It is on the 'Main Course' tab and is scrolled down to the 'Gallery' section, showing pictures of Pierogi.

      <h5 class="title-of-sect">Recipe Website - <i>May 2024, Web Design & Development</i></h5>
      <p class="section">The Recipe Project's brief was quite simple, make a multi-page website about recipes that you liked, it must have 5 courses, and instructions on how to make them, with images. I decided to make mine be about Polish cuisine, picking some of my favorite dishes and theming the website around that.<br>
      I was proud of myself at the time for learning how to use the flex display for the images in the gallery, and for trying to use an iFrame on some courses to display a website with a different recipe, and for challenging myself with making a horizontal nav bar. But one thing I would improve though is, on some of the courses I decided to use drop downs to make the instructions more concise (until the user clicked on it to expand it), but I wish I had added a CSS rule so that on hover the mouse turned into the hand state to show that it was clickable better. I might try my hand at improving upon this one, or making a new website like this again later :).<br>
      And overall, I am happy with this project. It let me think about how to better make multi-page websites and challenged me with styling more than any other project had at that point!<br>

        <img class="project-image" alt="A screenshot of a project in CodeHS. On the left side is some of the code for the project, written entirely in HTML, all styling done in it. On the other, is a preview of the website. It has a sage green background with the title of the poem and the author it is by. It has an image in the middle of a bird perching on a branch, surounded by bordering images of leaves below and above it." src="/Images/Portfolio/Blackbird-Poem-Website.png">

      <h5 class="title-of-sect">Blackbird Poem Website - <i>April 2024, Web Design & Development</i></h5>
      <p class="section">This project was one of the first websites I ever made. The brief for it was to make a website showcasing the poem by Wallance Stevens, titled "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird."<br>
      I decided to put each section in its own area, some getting the breadth of the page and an image, and some being put in groups of 4 in a table. I tried incoperating bits of the poem into the images (usually with filters on them) and annotating the text with color to build interest.<br>
      I made this before we covered using an actual CSS file, so chaotically all the styling code is inside the head tag. So, to improve this project, I would first move the styling of it to its own CSS file. I would also fix some of the CSS stylings to be more succient since I now know how to use CSS selectors and have bettered my overall knowledge of CSS since then.<br>
      Overall, this small project serves as a great place to see how far I've come with my web development skills and to remind myself there are always places to improve and more things to learn. :)<br>
